Last updated: 2026-02-18

## Status Summary

1. `phase-01.md` - Completed
2. `phase-02.md` - Completed
3. `phase-03.md` - Completed (Blog MVP implementation baseline)
4. `phase-04.md` - Completed (security and quality gate enforcement)
5. `phase-05.md` - Active (incident and debugging protocol)
6. `phase-06.md` - Active (release and deployment governance)
7. `phase-07.md` - Planned (SaaS readiness, post-MVP)

## Current Focus

- Primary delivery is Blog MVP as defined in
  `docs/plans/ROADMAP-2026-BLOG-MVP.md`.
- Phases 03 through 06 govern implementation quality and release discipline
  during this workstream.

## Usage

- Update phase status and checkboxes when milestone state changes.
- If implementation changes architecture, add a new ADR and reference it here.
- Keep this board synchronized with `docs/plans/ROADMAP-2026-BLOG-MVP.md`.
