# Phase 02 - Design System and UX

Status: Completed
Last updated: 2026-02-18

## Outcome

A token-driven shared UI foundation is in place for marketing and admin surfaces.

## Completed Controls

- [x] Shared design-token direction documented and enforced.
- [x] Core UI primitive inventory established (`src/components/ui`).
- [x] Composition-layer component sets created (`layout`, `metrics`, `forms`, `editor`).
- [x] Navigation and shell patterns aligned across public and admin routes.

## Ongoing Expectations

- Continue using token classes and avoid hardcoded palette drift.
- Preserve accessibility and keyboard support in new composed components.
- Reuse component composition sets before introducing route-local UI patterns.
