# Reference Index

Last updated: 2026-02-18

Use this folder for implementation contracts that are more operational than ADRs
and more stable than task-specific notes.

## Core Infrastructure

- `docs/reference/lib-env.md`
- `docs/reference/lib-utils.md`
- `docs/reference/lib-errors.md`

## Feature Contracts

- `docs/reference/feature-auth.md`
- `docs/reference/feature-users.md`
- `docs/reference/feature-contact-email.md`

## UI and Composition

- `docs/reference/ui-component-inventory.md`
- `docs/reference/component-composition-sets.md`

## Delivery-Focus References

- `docs/reference/blog-editor-mvp.md`
- `docs/reference/routing-surface-map.md`

## Rules

- Keep references implementation-focused and path-accurate.
- Update references in the same change-set as contract changes.
- If a reference implies an architecture decision change, add a new ADR.
