# Architecture Decision Records

Last updated: 2026-02-18

## Canonical ADR Docs

- `docs/adr/ADR-SUMMARY-0001-0022.md` contains consolidated decision context.
- `docs/adr/archive/` contains immutable ADR source documents (`0001` through `0022`).

## ADR Rules

1. Archived ADR files are immutable.
2. New architectural changes require a new ADR in `docs/adr/` (not in `archive/`).
3. If a decision changes, publish a superseding ADR and reference prior ADR numbers.

## Next ADR Number

- `0023`

## Current Focus

- Blog MVP implementation and editorial workflow completion must align with ADR
  contracts, especially `0004`, `0010`, `0012`, `0013`, `0014`, and `0020`.
