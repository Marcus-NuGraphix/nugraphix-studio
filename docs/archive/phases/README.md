- This board is now historical for the MVP implementation stream.
- Active production-readiness execution board is
  `docs/08-implementation/01-phased-plan.md`.
- Active roadmap is `docs/plans/ROADMAP-2026-PRODUCTION-HARDENING.md`.

## Usage

- If implementation changes architecture, add a new ADR and reference it here.
- Keep this board as a historical record for the Blog MVP stream.
