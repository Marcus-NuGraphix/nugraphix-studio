# Phase 01 - Strategy and Foundations

Status: Completed
Last updated: 2026-02-18

## Outcome

The foundational product direction and platform boundaries are established:

- Nu Graphix Studio serves public marketing plus internal operations.
- MVP cutline favors implementation discipline over feature sprawl.
- Future SaaS readiness is preserved without premature complexity.

## Completed Controls

- [x] Product positioning and audience definition.
- [x] Core MVP scope and out-of-scope boundaries.
- [x] Success metrics categories (business + internal + engineering).
- [x] Baseline technical stack locked.

## Carry-Forward Constraints

- Preserve architecture discipline and feature-first boundaries.
- Prevent scope creep during Blog MVP delivery.
- Treat production as operational infrastructure, not an experiment.
