Status: Historical

## Purpose

This folder stores superseded documentation that remains useful for historical
context, audits, and traceability.

## Contents

- `docs/archive/roadmaps/*` - legacy/completed roadmap documents.
- `docs/archive/phases/*` - completed Blog MVP phase execution records.
- `docs/archive/legacy-path-notes.md` - migration notes for legacy path cleanup.

## Rules

- Archived files are read-only historical records.
- Do not use archive docs as active execution source of truth.
- Current source of truth is `docs/00-index.md` and `docs/08-implementation/*`.
